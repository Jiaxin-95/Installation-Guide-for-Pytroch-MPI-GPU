## As the python file that is going to be executed should be located at the same directory on all workers
# To simplify the settings, we can create a new user account with the name of e.g. "mpi" on each worker
adduser mpi

## Log onto "master" node and create an ssh key pair for MPI backend
ssh master@{master's ip}
ssh-keygen -t rsa

## Enable ssh connection from master to worker nodes without passphrase
ssh-copy-id mpi@{each worker's ip}
pkill ssh-agent
eval `ssh-agent`
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa


## Common issues (these are all the problems I was suffered from xD)
# 1. Execution is terminated due to cannot locate the file that is supposed to be run.
# Place all the files into a directory that can be accessed with the same path.
# For example, leave the files at /home/mpi/
mpirun -np 4 /home/mpi/TorchMPI.py

# 2. OpenMPI environment variables are already set on each node, but still indicated that the configurations are not correctly
# Solution: 
# The flag "--prefix /usr/local/openmpi" should always be added when using the command "mpirun", even though you have correctly configured all the environment variables (PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH) for OpenMPI.
# i.e.
mpirun --prefix /usr/local/openmpi -np 8 /home/mpi/TorchMPI.py

# 3. Username on each node are not exectly same
# Solution:
# Setup a text hostfile on master machine to figure it out, since the flag "-host user1@node1,user2@node2" cannot work properly.
# An example hostfile, where the file name is "nodes":
user1@{node1's ip} slots=4 max-slots=4
user2@{node2's ip} slots=4 max-slots=4
mpirun --prefix /usr/local/openmpi --hostfile /home/master/nodes -np 8 /home/mpi/TorchMPI.py

# 4. Cannot find python for cannot find the Torch/Vision/Pytorch that we just compiled with Anaconda's Python
# Solution:
# It dues to the locations of Anaconda's Python is varied on each node. To solve it, you may need to uninstall Anaconda and remove Pytorch completely and then reinstall them to a common location such as "/etc/opt". 
rm -rf ~/anaconda3 # if Anaconda was installed here
rm -rf ~/.conda
rm -rf ~/pytorch # if Pytorch was installed here
rm -rf ~/vision # if Vision was installed here
# To install ANaconda and compile Pytorch, please refer to my tutorial (https://github.com/aca10jl/Installation-Guide-for-Pytroch-MPI-GPU/blob/master/Pytorch+MPI+GPU+Ubuntu18.txt)

# 5. Communication issue between nodes not due to some reasons
# Solution:
# Manually define the "root ip" address for the communication destination.
# Firstly, take a look at your networks and find out the "root ip"
netstat -nr
# In my case, the nodes are on 10.10.10.5, 10.10.10.6, 10.10.10.7, etc., where the "root ip" should be 10.10.10.0
mpirun --prefix /usr/local/openmpi --hostfile /home/master/nodes --mca btl_tcp_if_include 10.10.10.0/24 -np 8 /home/mpi/TorchMPI.py
